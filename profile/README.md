# Arkane Linux
Arkane Linux is an opinionated, immutable, atomic, multi-root Arch-based distibution which aims to provide a GNOME-centered experienced with minimal yet full featured and sensible non-intrusive defaults.

Arkane Linux primarily serves as a reference implementation, development environment and my personal configuration of the [Arkdep](https://github.com/arkanelinux/arkdep) immutable system management toolkit.
